This CS16 student was having trouble implementing a function, countPrimes() (shown at bottom of main.cpp). In this particular case, the student seemed to be on the right track with declaring a boolean variable, but they did not handle the starting value correctly. In addition, the student's last if statement to check this boolean was also on the right track, but was not placed in the correct location. Eventually, after tracing through some test cases, the student was able to address both of these issues.
